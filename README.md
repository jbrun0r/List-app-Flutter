Task List application developed in **Dart** language with **SDK** (Software Development Kit) **Flutter** for _Android, iOS_ and _Web_.
<br>

##

### Brief:
After developing a Mobile Application of decentralized information with **Flutter SDK**, I understood numerous details that an application should follow such as: the study of colors, the size/shape of a button, guiding users through a path between the moment access to the final goal, to make this process pleasant and useful, so that the user not only follows the path, but enjoys the process and comes back more often, [...]. Then I reached the conception of the complexity of an Interface. So, with the vision of an **_Engineer_** and not more than a simple Programmer, I walked in the development of some _Apps_ in **Flutter** willing to apply and amplify the aforementioned understandings, incorporating the computational logic necessary for each project and this was the Application (**one**).

##
#### Complement:
The Application was developed in the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment, using packages to improve fluidity and asynchronous methods, manipulating json files and making the tasks perennial.
